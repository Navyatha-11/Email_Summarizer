Academic Policies - Feedback Form for Upcoming SUGC and SPGC Meetings & Information,"""'Secretary, Academic Affairs' via Students, IIT Hyderabad"" <students@iith.ac.in>","Dear All, I hope this email finds you well and thriving in your academic and personal pursuits. Many of you would have been facing a lot of problems with Academics due to any policy or problems with curricula. With a Senate Meeting coming up in this month, preceded by meetings with the Dean (Academics), SUGC and SPGC, I would like to collect information/feedback on various academic policies, confusions and issues faced. *What will the Academic Affairs Council do?* Based on the volume of feedback and feasibility of implementation, we shall forward the *relevant* suggestions to the aforementioned meetings. I will keep the student in the loop via the SUGC/SPGC Representative of your batch. The SUGC Representatives of UG 2022, 2023 and 2024 batches are selected and cc'd in this email; while the SPGC Representatives as well as the SUGC Representatives of UG 2025 and 5-year Dual Degree batch will be selected soon. Please note that we can not guarantee that we will propose every point given in feedback in the upcoming meetings due to time constraints, however, this academic year shall have three more Senate meetings and thus plenty of room to cover all the feedback. It will be dealt on the basis of importance/impact of the issue and demand by the student community. *Whom will my feedback be addressed to?* Some of the feedback will be routed directly to Dean, who will in turn direct the agenda he deems worthy to the SUGC/SPGC meeting for recommendation followed by approval in the Senate. The rest will be directed to the DUGC/DPGC of your respective department based on the nature of feedback; and you can see the output in the Senate Minutes after the Senate meeting next month. *Issues to Avoid Mentioning In The Form:* *Policies not dealt with by the Senate* 1. *Grade changes for a particular student:* This is dealt with by the instructor. 2. *Any financial/fee-related Issues:* This is only dealt with by the Senate - Section (B), in which Student Representatives are forbidden. 3. *Any AIIMS Portal Issues:* This is dealt with by the AIIMS Office. 4. *KRC, OCS, Gymkhana or Other Cell/Club/CR Council Related Issues:* This is not dealt with by the Senate. 5. *Changing Instructor/Grading Policy/Slot Changes of a Specific Course:* Dealt with by the instructor only. Failure to follow the above instructions would lead to non-consideration of your feedback. *Issues Encouraged:* Please have a look at the minutes of previous Senate meetings to have an understanding of what sort of issues are dealt with by the Senate. The link for this is present in my signature. I encourage you to fill out curriculum-related or policy-related issues (basically, anything covered by the Academic Handbook which requires changes). *Google Form Link * Note: You can also give feedback anonymously if you wish to. *Keeping You in the Loop:* If you want to know the position of your proposal in the form, please reply to this email. As the student group is large, I may not respond individually to each email on this, I request the respective SUGC/SPGC Representatives to respond if possible. In case you do not receive a response within a few days, you may reach out to me in the chat option given in mail. *Academic Queries:* In case of any academic query, you may always reach out to your *Class Representative* at any moment of time. In case of no response, the next point of contact would be, in order, the SUGC/SPGC Representative followed by Academic Affairs Secretary. We will redirect you to the appropriate authorities, if need be. *Sai Rishi Kasturi* Secretary of Academic Affairs Student Gymkhana 2025 - 2026 +91 94900 44323 Minutes of Senate Meetings -- Disclaimer:- This footer text is to convey that this email is sent by one of the users of IITH.

Re: Implementation of 24×7 Library Access as Promised,Director IIT Hyderabad <director@iith.ac.in>,"Dear friends, I am committed to keeping the library open 24x7. I told this to our Librarian almost 3 months back. However, we needed additional staff for this and I approved additional staff. The library has now acquired the additional staff. *I want the library to start functioning 24x7 from September 15th.* However, only certain sections of the library will be open after 12 midnight for easy monitoring. I hope the students will use it for the purpose for which the Library is meant for. Anyone who misuses this opportunity provided will not have access to the library. To the best of my knowledge, there are very few academic institutes in India (or possibly none) where the library is open 24x7 (except for the exams time) and we are making this exception for our institute to provide opportunity to those who want to make use of this opportunity for study purposes) . warm regards, Murty ************************************************ प्रो. बी.एस. मूर्ति/ Prof. B.S.

Greetings and Call for Ideas for Academic Transformation@IITH,Dean Academic <dean.acad@iith.ac.in>,"Dear Students, Greetings from the Office of Academics Affairs at IIT Hyderabad and congratulations to all the students community for IITH achieving all time highest 7th Rank at NIRF under the guidance and leadership of our Director. On behalf of academic office, we thank all the on roll 5751 (UG:PG=41:59) and graduated 8589 (UG:PG=38:62) students for their hard work in publishing quality research articles and participating in prestigious and innovative competitions and hackathons. Thanks to different students clubs which have played crucial role in keeping the students activities and academic creativity go in parallel. As you know, any great Institutions like world's number one MIT and India's number one IIT Madras are able to maintain the highest standing among all of the Institution primarily due to the creative and innovative academic activities, quality research publications (Q-factor), and development of technical solutions for the nation and the world at large. While many of you are doing hard work towards achieving some of the above goals to some extent, I am sure many of you, like me, willing to see IITH also in the league of those Institution in the years to come! It is a proud moment of all of us what we have achieved in shorter span of 17 Yrs but need lots of discipline and measured direction to achieve the excellence in academics like other great Institutions. Though, we have had prestigious Universities like Nalanda, we are on the path of making our Indian Institutions great again. While doing so I would like to remind you that even University like Allahabad University used to be called Harvard of East, the quality of the Institution started degrading due to lack of discipline by the students and others at the helm! As we are on the path of creating history by promoting innovative and creative teaching methodology, interdisciplinary programs, Industry based research problems, hands-on activities based on NEP, hackathons, inviting companies, national and multinational, to open their offices in Technology Research Park and to give Industrial lectures, Joining hands with foreign and Indian Institutions to train the manpower of current and future technologies for taking the Indian Economy from 4th to 3rd in the world. While we perform our duties, we expect your active involvement in the pursuit of achieving the goals of the Institute as well as the Nation in serving the humanity at its best! While we go upward to the peak of the mountain, any deviation from the goal will make us fall back. Therefore, I encourage you to take the leadership role with hard work, perseverance and most important disciplined approach in achieving your goal of excellence in academics and other activities. To achieve this goal of academic excellence we invite you to share with us ideas on how to transform academics at IIT Hyderabad for all of us! I will end of message with an old saying which describes the quality of a best student: *श्लोक *(Shloka): *काक चेष्टा, बको ध्यानं, श्वान निद्रा तथैव च । अल्पाहारी, गृहत्यागी, विद्यार्थी पंच लक्षणं ॥ * *English Version*: *Kaak cheshta, bako dhyanam, shwan nidra tathaiva cha. Alpahari, grihtyaagi, vidyarthi panch lakshanam* *English Meaning*: Effort of a crow, concentration of a crane (or heron), light sleep like a dog, eating less, and less involvement in home matters—these are the five characteristics of a student. *Further Description*: Kak chesta: The effort or tireless endeavor of a crow. Bako dhyanam: The intense, focused concentration of a crane. Shwan nidra: The light, alert sleep of a dog, which wakes up at the slightest sound. Alpahari: One who eats only as much as is needed. Grihtyagi: One who renounces the comforts and attachments of home Thank you very much and looking forward to your active involvement in academic activities to make the learning fun and beneficial to all of you for which you are the part of the IITH community. Please do not hesitate to write to me any ideas that you have which can be implemented to achieve the best environment for teaching and learning.

This is just for notational convinience. Otherwise l(sign(g(x),y) cannot represent a surrogate like hinge loss as arguments take only label values. in summary, when we write l ( sign(g(x), y ) we actually mean a function of g(x) and y, which is according to the surrogate.

At the end, we get a sorry email from the organizers after damaging the reputation of IITH. If you arrange any event as a coordinator, the security section here will help you conduct the same. But, first, please consult with CSO to assess the security requirements, which depend on the number of participants, vehicle entries, vehicle parking, etc. Approval must be obtained from FIC(Security) by the coordinator well before time, subject to following the appropriate security arrangements suggested by the CSO. The coordinator and organizers will be responsible for any unwanted situation. Further, the following orders from the competent authority has to be followed without fail. ------- 1. Any activity by the students related to sports should be recommended by the FIC (Sports) with a clear proposal on the details of the participants, program and funds/sponsorship and should be approved by the Dean(students) in a written form. 2.
