Thanks to different students clubs which have\r\nplayed crucial role in keeping the students activities and academic\r\ncreativity go in parallel.\r\n\r\nAs you know, any great Institutions like world's number one MIT and India's\r\nnumber one IIT Madras are able to maintain the highest standing among all\r\nof the Institution primarily due to the creative and innovative academic\r\nactivities, quality research publications (Q-factor), and development of\r\ntechnical solutions for the nation and the world at large.\r\n\r\nWhile many of you are doing hard work towards achieving some of the above\r\ngoals to some extent, I am sure many of you, like me, willing to see IITH\r\nalso in the league of those Institution in the years to come! It is a proud\r\nmoment of all of us what we have achieved in shorter span of 17 Yrs but\r\nneed lots of discipline and measured direction to achieve the excellence in\r\nacademics like other great Institutions. Though, we have  had prestigious\r\nUniversities like Nalanda, we are on the path of making our Indian\r\nInstitutions great again. While doing so I would like to remind you that\r\neven University like Allahabad University used to be called Harvard of\r\nEast, the quality of the Institution started degrading due to lack of\r\ndiscipline by the students and others at the helm!\r\n\r\nAs we are on the path of creating history by promoting innovative and\r\ncreative teaching methodology, interdisciplinary programs, Industry based\r\nresearch problems, hands-on activities based on NEP, hackathons, inviting\r\ncompanies, national and multinational, to open their offices in Technology\r\nResearch Park and to give Industrial lectures, Joining hands with foreign\r\nand Indian Institutions to train the manpower of current and future\r\ntechnologies for taking the Indian Economy from 4th to 3rd in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile we perform our duties, we expect your active involvement in the\r\npursuit of achieving the goals of the Institute as well as the Nation in\r\nserving the humanity at its best! While we go upward to the peak of the\r\nmountain, any deviation from the goal will make us fall back. Therefore, I\r\nencourage you to take the leadership role with hard work, perseverance and\r\nmost important disciplined approach in achieving your goal of excellence in\r\nacademics and other activities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal of academic excellence we invite you to share with us\r\nideas on how to transform academics at IIT Hyderabad for all of us!\r\n\r\nI will end of message with an old saying which describes the quality of a\r\nbest student:\r\n\r\n*श्लोक *(Shloka): *काक चेष्टा, बको ध्यानं, श्वान निद्रा तथैव च । अल्पाहारी,\r\nगृहत्यागी, विद्यार्थी पंच लक्षणं ॥ *\r\n\r\n*English Version*: *Kaak cheshta, bako dhyanam, shwan nidra tathaiva cha.\r\nAlpahari, grihtyaagi, vidyarthi panch lakshanam*\r\n\r\n*English Meaning*: Effort of a crow, concentration of a crane (or heron),\r\nlight sleep like a dog, eating less, and less involvement in home\r\nmatters—these are the five characteristics of a student.\r\n\r\n*Further Description*:\r\n\r\nKak chesta: The effort or tireless endeavor of a crow.\r\nBako dhyanam: The intense, focused concentration of a crane.\r\nShwan nidra: The light, alert sleep of a dog, which wakes up at the\r\nslightest sound.\r\nAlpahari: One who eats only as much as is needed.\r\nGrihtyagi: One who renounces the comforts and attachments of home\r\n\r\nThank you very much and looking forward to your active involvement in\r\nacademic activities to make the learning fun and beneficial to all of you\r\nfor which you are the part of the IITH community.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to write to me any ideas that you have which can be\r\nimplemented to achieve the best environment for teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nProf. Ashok Kumar Pandey\r\nDean (Acad), IIT Hyderabad\r\nOffice: 408 Admin Block\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:- This footer text is to convey that this email is sent by one \r\nof the users of IITH.

This  \r\nis just for notational convinience. Otherwise l(sign(g(x),y) cannot  \r\nrepresent a surrogate like hinge loss as arguments take only label values.  \r\nin summary, when we write l ( sign(g(x), y ) we actually mean a function of  \r\ng(x) and y, which is according to the surrogate.
